I am a Research Assistant at the [Agentic Intelligence Lab](https://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/) at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by [Prof. Jiayu Chen](https://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/members/jiayu-chen.html). My current research focuses on **Embodied AI** and **Continual Reinforcement Learning** for Humanoid Robotic Control.

Prior to joining HKU, I obtained my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from **Sharif University of Technology** in Tehran, Iran, where I graduated with a high distinction (GPA: 17.66/20). During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Mechatronics Lab and the Spine Biomechanics Lab, gaining extensive experience in:

* **Deep Reinforcement Learning** (Motion Planning for Robotic Systems)
* **Robotics & Control** (Exoskeletons and Manipulators)
* **Biomechanics** (Risk Assessment and Motion Analysis)

I am passionate about bridging the gap between classical control theory and modern AI to create intelligent, autonomous systems capable of operating in complex environments.
